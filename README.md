Blackjack decision making assistant

## 07/02/2023

Hello, a weekend ago I had some blackjack runs with a friend. Blackjack is the least luck based betting game I ever had, as the consequences of your skills influence the output.
Because I noticed a pattern in my decision making, and because a person that I care about wanted to try blackjack out; I decided to make this python code that would assist anyone, including myself in the future in case I forget the rules,
into maxing out the profit (provided the cards are not cheated of course.)
The decision making mechanism follows a logical algorithm that depends on some probability calculations. in the following paragraphs I will present the algorithm and further explain the ideas behind it.
