Blackjack decision making assistant

## 07/02/2023

Hello, a weekend ago I had some blackjack runs with a friend. Blackjack is the least luck based casino game I ever could play, as the consequences of your skills influence the output more than the luck factor.
Because I noticed a pattern in my decision making, and because a person that I care about wanted to try blackjack out; I decided to make this python code that would assist anyone, including myself in the future in case I forget the rules,
into maxing out the profit (provided the cards are not cheated of course.)
The decision making mechanism follows a logical algorithm that depends on some probability calculations. in the following paragraphs I will present the algorithm and further explain the ideas behind it.
As of today, the core of the code contains only the structure of the hand and some basic decision suggestions given to the player.
I highly recommend reading [this article](https://probability.infarom.ro/blackjack.html#:~:text=The%20total%20number%20of%20possible,of%20a%202%2Ddeck%20game.)
